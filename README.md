# ML-Library

This is a machine learning library that I am building using only numpy and sympy.

## Overview

Currently, this library supports the following algorithms

1. Perceptron
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. K-Means Clustering
4. DBSCAN: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
5. Linear Regression
6. PCA: Principal Component Analysis
7. Univariate function optimization using Gradient Descent
